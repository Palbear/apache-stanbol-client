Michael Jordan 1993 retirement isn't one of the great what if stories of all time I repeat, as Jordan often did, isn't, but people don't believe
Jordan, who had been fatigued beyond compare by three straight championships, the 1992 Olympics, incessant off the court questions about his outrageous gambling debts, and the tragic murder of his father in July of 1993, badly needed a break by the time the 1993-94 training camp was set to start up. Wearied at the prospect of yet another nine month trip to another potential championship, Jordan stepped aside.
And if he didn't step aside in 1993, it would have happened in 1994. If the Beatles hadn't broken up in 1970, then they certainly would have done it in 1971. Enough was enough, and it was time for a break.
